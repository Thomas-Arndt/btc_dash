A Bitcoin blockchain explorer with a simple to use user interface.

Technologies used: React,js, Node,js, Axios

In an effort to keep things simple, this application is contained within a single page. A large amount of information stored in the Bitcoin blockchain can be accessed using only a few points of interaction from the user.

The user can:
- Click on any of the ten most recent blocks to view statistics and transactions of that block
- Search for a block by block-height, or by block hash.
- Search for a transaction by transaction ID
- View information on the current mempool in the form of potential blocks waiting to be added.

The future of this project will include more views with more detailed lists of blocks/transactions, graphs of statistics over time, etc.
